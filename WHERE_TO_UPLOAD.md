# 📤 Where to Find "Upload Files" on GitHub

## You're Looking at the Right Page!

I can see from your screenshot you're on the repository main page. Here's where to find the upload option:

## Method 1: Look for "uploading an existing file" Link

On the page you're currently viewing, look in the **blue "Quick setup" box**:

1. Find the text that says: **"Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file"**
2. Click on **"uploading an existing file"** (it's a clickable link)
3. This will take you to the upload page

**In your screenshot, it's in the blue box in the middle of the page!**

## Method 2: Use the "Add file" Button

If you don't see the blue box:

1. Look for the **"Add file"** button (usually green, near the top right)
2. Click it
3. Select **"Upload files"** from the dropdown
